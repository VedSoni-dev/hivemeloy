## Step 5: Test AI Features

### 🗣️ Test AI Chat

1. **Sign in** as User 1 (Alex)
2. **Click the sparkle button** (bottom-right)
3. **Try these queries**:
   - "Find someone who knows Python"
   - "Who's working on climate tech?"
   - "Find a co-founder for my startup"
   - "Who knows both React and Machine Learning?"

You should see relevant users appear with match scores!

---

### 🕸️ Test Social Graph

1. **Click the network icon** (🕸️) in the header
2. **Observe the graph**:
   - Alex and Morgan should be close (both know React & Python)
   - Sara and Jordan might cluster (both Python & tech heavy)
   - Taylor should connect to multiple people
3. **Try filters**:
   - Search for "Python"
   - Filter by "Online" status
4. **Click a node** to highlight connections

---

### 💡 Test Recommendations

1. **Check the right sidebar** (automatically shows)
2. **Tab 1 - "For You"**:
   - Should show Morgan (high match - React + Python)
   - Should show Jordan or Sara (Python overlap)
   - Each shows match % and reasons
3. **Tab 2 - "Communities"**:
   - Should show 1-2 communities forming
   - One might be "React/Web Dev" (Alex, Morgan)
   - Another might be "Python/AI" (Sara, Jordan, Morgan)
4. **Tab 3 - "Your Role"**:
   - Should analyze your position
   - Show connection counts
   - Display unique skills

---

## Step 6: Update Your Profile

1. **Click "Edit Profile"** on the home tab
2. **Add skills**: React, JavaScript, Firebase, etc.
3. **Describe your project**: "Building an AI-powered social network for developers"
4. **Add background**: Your expertise and experience
5. **Save** and watch recommendations update!

---

## 🎯 What You Should See

### With 5 users:
- **AI Chat**: Accurate matches to your queries
- **Graph**: 3-5 visible connections (links between users)
- **Recommendations**: 2-4 suggested matches with 40-80% scores
- **Communities**: 1-2 clusters detected
- **Your Role**: "Active Member" or "Bridge Builder"

### The Magic:
- **Real-time updates**: Add a skill → recommendations change
- **Explainable**: Every match shows *why* (shared skills, interests)
- **Interactive**: Click anywhere → see details
- **Visual**: Force-directed graph clusters similar people

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Loading forever"
- **Check**: Is Firebase configured correctly?
- **Fix**: Verify `src/utils/firebase.js` has your config

### Issue: "No recommendations"
- **Check**: Do users have skills and projects filled out?
- **Fix**: Edit profiles to add more details

### Issue: "Empty graph"
- **Check**: Are there multiple users in the database?
- **Fix**: Create 3+ users with overlapping skills

### Issue: "AI chat shows no matches"
- **Check**: Are you searching for skills that exist?
- **Try**: Broader queries like "Find someone online"

---

## 📚 Next Steps

1. **Invite real users** - The more users, the better the AI works
2. **Customize matching** - Edit `src/utils/aiMatchingEngine.js`
3. **Add more skills** - Expand the skill taxonomy
4. **Integrate real AI** - Use OpenAI API for smarter chat
5. **Add projects** - Create project entities users can join

## 🎓 Understanding the AI

### How matching works:
```
User A: React, JavaScript, Building social app
User B: React, Node.js, Building web platform

Score breakdown:
- Shared skills (React): +12.5 points
- Similar projects (social/platform/web): +15 points
- Total: ~27.5 out of 100 = 28% match
```

### How communities form:
- Users with 40%+ similarity cluster together
- Communities share common skills/interests
- Example: All Python users might form one community

### How roles are determined:
- **5+ strong connections (60%+ match)**: Core Connector
- **2-5 strong connections**: Active Member
- **Many diverse connections**: Bridge Builder
- **Few connections**: Newcomer

## ✨ Tips for Best Results

1. **Complete profiles** - More details = better matches
2. **Be specific** - "React developer" > "programmer"
3. **Use the chat** - Natural language works!
4. **Explore the graph** - Visual patterns reveal communities
5. **Check recommendations daily** - Updates as network grows
