# fred.ai - AI-Powered Social Knowledge Graph

## 🎯 **New Vision**

Transform fred.ai from a traditional dashboard into an **intelligent social graph** where an AI agent helps users discover connections, collaborators, and opportunities within the Meloy Room community.

---

## 🧠 **Core Concept**

### **Users as Nodes**
Each user is a node with rich attributes:
- **Name & Bio**: Identity and background
- **Skills**: Technical capabilities (React, AI, Hardware, etc.)
- **Interests**: Areas of passion (robotics, climate tech, fintech)
- **Projects**: Current and past ventures
- **Affiliations**: Organizations, clubs, research groups
- **Status**: In Room / Online / Away
- **Availability**: Looking for collaborators, mentors, co-founders

### **Connections as Edges**
Relationships between users:
- **Collaborations**: Working on projects together
- **Shared Interests**: Common goals or domains
- **Skill Complementarity**: Different skills that mesh well
- **AI-Recommended**: Suggested by the intelligent system
- **Mentorship**: Senior-junior relationships

### **AI Agent Interface**
Instead of browsing, users **chat with fred.ai**:
```
User: "Find someone I can make a robotics startup with"
fred.ai: "I found 3 great matches:
         1. Alex Chen - Embedded systems expert, built 2 robots
         2. Sarah Kim - Mechanical engineering, looking for co-founder
         3. Mike Johnson - AI/ML specialist, interested in robotics"
```
